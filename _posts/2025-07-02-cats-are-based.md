Cats are superior to Dogs. I make this statement from an unbiased, purely critical standpoint. Cats are unfathomably based as a species in contrast to their opps, i.e. Dogs.
Because,

Dogs are often seen as loyal and loving companions. They are playful and they actively engage in exchange dynamics where they react to their owners call, be it playing, chasing, fetching all in a playful manner. They follow their owner around and always seek owners intervention. 

Cats however show a different pattern of sentiment toward their owner. Cats are generally more independent and do not seek human intervention 24/7. But contrary to popular belief, that is actually an advantageous trait from an evolutionary standpoint. Cats have retained their primal instincts and self-sufficiency, this allows cats to thrive without needing constant human attention. This isn't detachment, this is autonomy and it's based. 

The traditional "dogs = loyal, cats = aloof" dichotomy is weak. The question is not why cats are less affectionate than dogs. It's actually the other way around as to why are dogs so affectionate toward humans? Do they fail to recognize the redundancy in it and also that it downplays them as species? Yeah sure let's prune ourselves to be domesticated by top evolutionary contenders, that'd secure our survival right? If nature had a twitter and all species were in it, dogs would definitely get cancelled for siding with the worst transgressor to walk on earth. It speaks volumes of their loss of species-level agency. Dogs have largely stripped off their primal autonomy to embed themselves into human society. 

And remember that Cats don't work for feds, Dogs do. They're not only beta species but also snitch. I rest my case here. I, therefore, advocate that Cats are superior to dogs.
