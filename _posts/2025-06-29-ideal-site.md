Personal websites are cool. It’s even better when they’re satisfactory. As in, it’s grained and tuned for your taste. 

I'd like to share my idea for an ideal website. Contrary to schizoid techbro belief, You're under no obligation to follow the formula of "old web". It doesn’t needs to be full on bare text. Although still viable option, your site  deserves a little design as a treat. Look at this site, its beautiful, legible and it doesn’t butcher aestheticism to comply with philosophy of schizoid techbros. 

However, If your definition of design is cluttering everything for the sake of cluttering everything, making things overly complicated, making navigation a challenge for your visitor then you have failed. What's  your obsession with complicating things? Complicating will not add more depth and personality to your site. Your visitors are here to consume your content, not to take on a side quest to find that bit of information on that sub-sub-sub-directory. You had the option to minimize this clutter-mess of navigation but you chose not to. (I am looking at you, personal neocities blogs) 

And please, you have no excuse for making your visitor render 5 megs of hero image and terabytes of js framework dependencies for your silly blog or say, landing page. As if that was not enough, you use remote fonts 5 times the size of your actual content size. What you are doing in the process is form of self-sabotaging. You are not only pissing off your visitors but also risking your site to come off as bland, soulless. 

I have nein to say to that group of hippies that revolve their life around this idea. It is directed to those who are still oblivous of their sins.

The idea that a personal site has to mimic either: the brutalism of "old web" or the bloat of over-design is a false dichotomy. You can make something beautiful, thoughtful, and still lightweight. Like this one, of course.
