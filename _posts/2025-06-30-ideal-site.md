title: Idea of an Ideal website
---
 

Having your personal website is super cool. What's even cooler is having a site that works out for you. As in, it's grained and tuned for your personal taste. Like you are satisfied with what you've done and built. Maybe you're showcasing your creativity, writings, and academic stuff and you're satisfied with the overall structure. You may even pat yourself in the back for doing a pretty good job. 

Oh, but it has yet to occur to me. I never seem to be satisfied with how things turn out. The history of my battles with creating these personal sites aren't indexed anywhere. But do know that I've made tons of sites, every time I try to convince myself this one's real deal and we're sticking with it. Oh, but no. Something scratches a part of my brain, and I am fed up with the theme, the font, the flow, the very soul of it. And I vandalize it. I tear it down, rip out the parts I loved last week, throw on a new layout and stare at it until the dissatisfaction creeps in again.

Then there's this duality thing that's going on which I believe needs to be addressed. It's not even singular, it's with anything and everything. For example: hey I want my site to be super-hyper-aesthetic! It needs to have a lot of things going on! More buttons, more hyperlinks, more media queries, more more. And then in the back of my mind there's this ever aching desire to be a minimal, bare iron, pure text-based site that just gets the point across. A site that just shows up and speaks. I wouldn't want it to be content for the sake of being content. Or like a site trying to mimic having a soul by doing past what's necessary. You get me right? I hope you do.

Another one: hey I think I should go over the top with the content, it's my site after all. I should articulate whatever and however I desire, right? Oh, no. I should think of how visitors might perceive it. Can't go flamboyant with the contents, that'd just push them away from my site, or make them cringe? I might scare them off, or worse: embarrass myself later. 

And the content? Content is the elephant in the room. Like, what is this website even for? What should I commit to doing even? I've never settled down, went all in with what I want to do. So where do I start? Showcase? I've none to. Should I blog? Oh, that's cliche. Who honestly cares about what random netizen is doing with their life. What I'm reading? Thinking about? Writing? Feels almost presumptuous to assume someone might care. Everyone and their favourite faang algorithm has a blog. Oh, oops. Maybe you do. You've read this far into this rant after all. You're really my sweet coconut flavored ice cream.

Maybe the ideal website isn't a static artifact. It's something ever evolving, ever growing. Maybe you're supposed to learn from this and better it later. But then again I might even delete this one tomorrow so who knows?
