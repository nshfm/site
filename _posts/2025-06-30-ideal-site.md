Personal websites are cool. It's even better when they're satisfactory. As in, it's grained and tuned for your personal taste. Say, you're showcasing your creativity, writings, and academic stuff and you're satisfied with the overall structure. You may pat yourself in the back for doing a pretty good job. 

Yet I never seem to be satisfied with my sites architect. I never seem to be satisfied with how things turn out. I've experimented with tons of sites. I always feel restless with the outcome. Something scratches a part of my brain, and I am fed up with the theme, the font, the flow, the very soul of it. And I tear it down, rip out the parts I loved last week, throw on a new layout and stare at it until the dissatisfaction creeps in again.

Then there's this duality thing which I believe needs to be addressed. It's not even singular, it's with anything and everything. For example: hey I want my site to be super-hyper-aesthetic! It needs to have a lot of features and personality! More buttons, more hyperlinks, more media queries, more more. And then in the back of my mind there's this ever aching desire to be a minimal, bare iron, pure text-based site that just gets the point across. A site that just shows up and speaks. Because I wouldn't want it to be content for the sake of being content. Or like a site trying to mimic having a soul by doing past what's necessary. You get me right? I hope you do.

Or: hey I think I should go over the top with the content. It's my site after all. I should articulate whatever and however I desire, right? Oh, but no. I should think of how visitors might perceive it. Can't go flamboyant with the contents, that'd just push them away from my site, or make them cringe? I might scare them off, or worse: embarrass myself later. 

And the content? Content is the elephant in the room. Like, what is this website even for? What should I do with it? I've never settled down with what I want to do. So where do I start? Showcase? I've none to. Should I blog? Oh, that's cliche. Who honestly cares about what random netizen is doing with their life. What I'm reading? Thinking about? Writing? Feels almost presumptuous to assume someone might care. Everyone and their favourite faang algorithm has a blog. Oops. Maybe you do. You've read this far into this rant after all. You're really my sweet coconut flavored ice cream.

Maybe the ideal website isn't a static artifact. It's something ever evolving, ever growing. Maybe you're supposed to learn from this and better it later. But then again I might even delete this one tomorrow so who knows?
