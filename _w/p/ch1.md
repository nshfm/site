A place and an observer, outside the realm of all creation such that the observer holds said place in a maticulous manner. 
Therein resides another observer who dramatically observes our first canonical observer holding his(2nd observer) place of being.
In response to such divine intervention, he pondered to himself, "Quite fascinating", "Is such a beautiful event taking place in reality or say, unreality?", he added. Our 2nd observer was in awe, flabbergasted even. 
He then reached a station of conclusion in his train of thought, "I have decided. I should, no, I must name this phenomenon." "I will name it... I will name it placeholder", that's the most uncreative title anyone could've possibly assigned to this divine intervention. But irony of complex plane, he was the only being to observe this fascination. Therefore, we're left with no choice but to adapt his title. So placeholder it is.
