Our first observer seems to be quite intrigued with our 2nd observer. 1st observer whispers to himself, "Well uhhhh that's new." "I'm not too sure how I should be reacting to this" he goes on.
"Never in my lifetime have I witnessed anything as interesting as this tidbit. This creature somehow have observed ME in process of observing itself." 
Our first observer seems to be wresting with their thoughts at the time. They continue after a small pause, "Mmhmm, yes, given enough thought that's quite interesting. But what of now? This phenomenon dictates the established rule"
"Which clearly states I alone am the only observer to observe the reality from my placement of unreality so that existence would suffice, so that it may go by flow from cause to effect a stream of river but really that's just oversimplification."
Our first observer shows hyper awareness of this dogmatic situation. 
"So what of now? There is now a 2nd observer in the picture and not to evade their silly tendency to label unknown."
