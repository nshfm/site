Can you believe it guys? New post, just a week away. New post is in a week! Woohoo! I am so happy about this information. New post! Just a week away, oh wow. Can you believe it? New post! Just in a week! It got here so fast! New post! Just a week away!

<h5> Here is reaction for synthesis of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) from benzene</h5>

Benzene can be converted to toluene through a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, where a methyl group (-CH₃) is added to the benzene ring, typically using methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). 


Reaction:

C₆H₆ + CH₃Cl → C₆H₅CH₃ + HCl


The synthesis of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) from toluene typically involves a three-step nitration process:

first, toluene is nitrated to mononitrotoluene (MNT), then MNT is nitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT), and finally, DNT is nitrated to TNT. 


Steps in the synthesis of TNT from Toluene:

    1. Nitration to Mononitrotoluene (MNT):
    Toluene reacts with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid.

reaction: C₆H₅CH₃ + HNO₃ → C₆H₄(NO₂)CH₃ + H₂O
    
    2. Nitration to Dinitrotoluene (DNT):
    The separated MNT is then subjected to a second nitration with a similar mixture of acids.

reaction: C₆H₄(NO₂)CH₃ + HNO₃ → C₆H₄(NO₂)₂CH₃ + H₂O

    3. Nitration to Trinitrotoluene (TNT):
    DNT is finally nitrated with an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) to yield TNT
    . 
reaction: C₆H₄(NO₂)₂CH₃ + HNO₃ → C₆H₄(NO₂)₃CH₃ + H₂O


Explosive Character 
Upon detonation, TNT undergoes a decomposition equivalent to the reaction

    2 C7H5N3O6 → 3 N2 + 5 H2 + 12 CO + 2 C

plus some of the reactions

    H2 + CO → H2O + C

and

    2 CO → CO2 + C.

The reaction is exothermic but has a high activation energy in the gas phase (~62 kcal/mol). The condensed phases (solid or liquid) show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal/mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities. Because of the production of carbon, TNT explosions have a sooty appearance. Because TNT has an excess of carbon, explosive mixtures with oxygen-rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than TNT alone. During the 20th century amatol, a mixture of TNT with ammonium nitrate, was a widely used military explosive.
